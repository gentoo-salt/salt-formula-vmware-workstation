TODO:
 - make sure the modules are present in /etc/conf.d/modules (use augeas)
   modules+="vmnet vmci vmmon"
 - investigate if license key can be added programatically (maybe use grains to store the key)
 - get rid of module.run from deps.sls and use augeas instead. if .config was changed, compile kernel and install it
